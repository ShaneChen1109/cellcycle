## 1. Downloading and processing the cell cycle scRNA-seq data
We download the scRNA-seq data of cell cycle from 




## 2. Estimating RNA velocity from scRNA-seq data





## 3. Reconstructing vector field of cell cycle dynamics





## 4. Constructing landscape-flux of cell cycle global dynamics and thermodynamics
